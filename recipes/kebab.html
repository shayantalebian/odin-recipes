    <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g lamb mincel</li>
        <li>1 small onion, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated</li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>Â¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>sunflower oil for oiling</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lets cook it:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. You can also just squish everything together
            in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown
            under the grill or with a blowtorch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, including our
