        If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is for you.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) prime rib roast</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lets cook it:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, see footnote to calculate cooking time.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
